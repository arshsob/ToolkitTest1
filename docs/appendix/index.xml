      <description>Case Studies #  Case Study 1 #  Cultural Diplomacy – Marshallese Cultural Diplomacy in Arkansas
The Republic of Marshall Islands (RMI) established a consulate in Springdale, Arkansas in 2009. With the efforts of the Consul-General, Carmen Chong-Gum (a Marshallese native), the Marshallese community has been able to engage in “cultural diplomacy” or outreach efforts to the resident communities through Marshallese cultural productions. For, Chong-Gum, cultural diplomacy occurs when the consulate is involved in cultural programming, which are projects that raise cultural awareness with specific educational, political, and economic goals in mind.</description>

      <description>Glossary #  Alap #  Typically the oldest uncle on the mother’s side of the family (Erdland, 1914). His capacity is as the head of the family and in charge of the weto. The alap can also be the eldest woman in the family. The alop is responsible for managing the weto and the family and ensuring that resources are distributed to sustain everyone on the weto. Today the traditional value of the alap is fleeting; many alaps seldom live on their wetos and many have migrated to the United States.</description>
