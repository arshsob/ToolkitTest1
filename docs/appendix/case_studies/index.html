<p><strong>Cultural Diplomacy – Marshallese Cultural Diplomacy in Arkansas</strong></p>
<p>The Republic of Marshall Islands (RMI) established a consulate in Springdale, Arkansas in 2009. With the efforts of the Consul-General, Carmen Chong-Gum (a Marshallese native), the Marshallese community has been able to engage in “cultural diplomacy” or outreach efforts to the resident communities through Marshallese cultural productions. For, Chong-Gum, cultural diplomacy occurs when the consulate is involved in cultural programming, which are projects that raise cultural awareness with specific educational, political, and economic goals in mind. Cultural programming can take many forms: festivals, monthly arts and music events, and celebrations of cultural and ethnic experiences unique to population or location. Ergo, cultural events organized by the church, for example, (even if outsiders are invited to participate) are not organized by the consulate and are therefore not cultural diplomacy. Marshallese efforts of cultural diplomacy aims at creating a productive space for transcultural communication and negotiation and they have created a unique politics of representation (Schwartz, 2015).</p>
<p><strong>Specific Events</strong></p>
<p>On February 28, 2013, the Consulate and Northwest Arkansas Community College (NWACC) held Marshall Islands Nuclear Victims and Survivors Memorial and Remembrance Day 2013. The event was part of a themed semester focused on the Marshall Islands at the college. The date is an RMI-recognized holiday to commemorate the Bravo detonation, the largest thermonuclear device detonated by the United States that sent irradiated coral dust across inhabited atolls in the Marshall Islands. During this event, the Bikinian gesture of cultural diplomacy through music and various cultural performances reminded their audience of their status as indigenous nuclear nomads. The tears shed and cross-cultural dialogue the activities of the event evoked among Marshallese and American was also the direct impetus behind the founding of the Marshallese Educational Initiative (MEI). Ultimately, the Bikinians’ affective performance at NWACC opened avenues for future educational outreach on awareness of Marshallese history and culture (Schwartz, 2015).</p>
<p>The thirty-fifth RMI Constitution Day was held in Springdale May 23–26, 2014. In the RMI, Constitution Day, or “R.M.I Jemenei Day” is held on May 1, but in the United States, it is held over Memorial Day weekend. This is usually done to give visiting Marshallese family members (among others) weekend travel time to be a part of the festivities. According to Chong-Gum, an important goal of the RMI Constitution Day celebrations has been to reach out to non-Marshallese residents with a gesture of cultural diplomacy (Schwartz, 2015, p. 797). The events are held over what the United States recognizes as a day to remember those who died in the service of the nation. This works well for the Marshallese as it gives them the opportunity to bring to the fore the sacrifices that all Marshallese have made and continue to make, whether it is their own lands or bodies, for the United States to maintain strategic interests and military readiness. In this regard, Marshallese take the imperial nationalistic time-space and insert their cultural productions (Schwartz, 2015).</p>
<p>Cultural diplomacy, as defined by Consul-General Chong-Gum, is a gesture made only when the Marshallese consulate is involved. However, the term cultural diplomacy takes on a more-nuanced, broader understanding when we look through the performative acts of the community and the voices of the community itself. Cultural diplomacy puts pressure on American notions of freedom as obtainable only through American individualism. Marshallese cultural diplomacy upholds the value of Marshallese ways of being and doing, specifically through ippan doon, which relies on presenting these connections within the larger community and invokes a greater sense of history through communal projects whose parameters are defined by the Marshallese.

<p><strong>Translocal Placemaking of the Hmong Diaspora</strong></p>
<p>The translocal practices of the Hmong challenge assumptions of placemaking, which calls for a reconsideration of how place is theorized in planning to better reflect new social formations and the overdetermination of locality. Farming in the United States is often described by Hmong as a link to their past, a link to Asia and their fellow co-ethnics there, and important to the reproduction of a Hmong way of life in diaspora (Rios &amp; Watkins, 2015).</p>
<p>In Sacramento, a weekly farmer’s market that has been operating for more than twenty-five years illustrates that translocal circuits come together as an assemblage of “emplaced practices” (“…the material becoming of place, for a time, as an assemblage of de-territorializations and re-territorializations circulating across space” (Rios &amp; Watkins, 2015, p. 212). The market is on the site of an abandoned gas station. For the weekend, the empty lot transforms into a place that is a buzz with activity. In addition to providing a viable income for many Hmong families, the Asian Market serves a social purpose, especially for Hmong elders that visit weekly with one another. Small-scale farming and the Asian Market reproduce a Hmong way of life in diaspora while adapting it to the context of relocation. Knowledge of farming techniques, crop production, and other valuable information is circulated through kinship networks and with other Hmong at the various farmers markets that are scattered throughout the Sacramento and San Joaquin Valleys. What makes the Asian Market unique is the blend of formality and informality, and the market’s material and symbolic status as a place where a Hmong way of life is combined with American Hmong way of life assembled through emplaced practices that circulate translocally (Rios &amp; Watkins, 2015, p. 214).</p>
<p>The activities of the Hmong population in Sacramento establish that places are assemblages of different cultures - circuits and flows of cultural, economic, and political practices near and far (Rios &amp; Joshua Watkins, 2015). In addition to the use of space for an Asian farmers market, there is an annual New Year’s celebration, which serves as a site of exchange among the larger diaspora community and is a vital component of Hmong-specific community and economic development, despite the absence of planners in helping to facilitate this ongoing event. The celebration brings together spatially separated villages, with a host village inviting Hmong from other villages to participate. Thus, many Hmong would not only take part in their own village’s celebration, but often travel to other village celebrations as the Hmong New Year runs roughly from November to December. The celebration forges alliances and operates as a means of developing social capital and the dissemination of information, custom, and material culture. For example, during the celebration the young and old wear traditional Hmong clothing, which serves as a means of bridging and reproducing culture and custom (Rios &amp; Watkins, 2015). The Hmong have continued to hold this celebration in the United States, in some respects adapting its tradition yet remaining true to its ethos of building and sustaining Hmong community across space.

<p><strong>Translocal Placemaking &amp; Identity – The Remaking of MacArthur Park</strong></p>
<p>Butcher (2009) contends that immigrants seek out and remake places where they can form social and cultural connections that reconfirm past identities. This is done by establishing spaces and activities and a social and cultural environment where they “share common frames of reference” to their sending communities (Butcher, 2009, p. 1366 quoted in Main &amp; Sandoval, 2015, p. 72). In the process of interacting with the host culture and/or immigrants from other sending communities, new frames of reference for identity are created. In ethnic and immigrant neighbourhoods, studies have documented the ways in which specific places become “imbued with public meaning” (Hummon, 1992), constitute “an important aspect of an immigrant’s place identity” (Mazumdar et al., 2000, p. 320), and strengthen the bonds between places and people (Altman and Low, 1992; Hummon, 1992; Low, 1992, 2000; Main, 2012; Manzo, 2003; Mazumdar et al., 2000; Milligan, 1998). Ultimately, Main &amp; Sandoval (2015) suggest that the continuity of identity related to place has significant consequences for well-being and strengthens the bonds between people and places.</p>
<p>MacArthur Park, in Los Angeles, California is an example of a place wherein immigrants reconfirm past identities. The park is used by a primarily foreign-born population, approximately 50% of whom have lived in the neighbourhood for fewer than 10 years. While both park users and other local community members within the area have immigrated from a number of Latin American countries, including Mexico, El Salvador, and Guatemala (US Census Bureau, 2010), the community has begun to identify itself as Central American (Los Angeles Times, 7 May 2007).</p>
<p>In their study, Main &amp; Sandoval (2015) found that the need to connect with and reproduce significant past environments motivates immigrants to engage in the everyday and political practices of placemaking in receiving communities. Study participants verified that through the physical elements – trees, flowers, fountains – and social and cultural elements of the park – other park visitors, soccer games and cultural celebrations, music and murals – they were able to reconnect with important places in their sending communities and achieve continuity of place identity. For other participants, reminders of important past places were already in the park – the flora and fauna, for instance. Many of the reminders were the result of participants remaking the park through everyday practices, including the “quiet encroachments” – a silent, patient, protracted, and pervasive advancement of ordinary people on the propertied and powerful…[t]hey are marked by quiet, atomized and prolonged mobilization with episodic collective action” (Bayat, 1997, p. 57) – of just being there. This connection with the place, Main &amp; Sandoval (2015) conclude is also linked with place identity and local action. With the connection that has been created with the park, it has morphed into a place wherein there have been manifestations of agency and resistance among immigrants and other community members (Main &amp; Sandoval, 2015). MacArthur Park has become a place wherein various immigrant rights activism activities in Los Angeles take place, and where the community engages in meaningful cultural practices, such as the establishment of annual celebrations of Feria Agostina and Central American Independence Day. In the final analysis, immigrants have reshaped local power dynamics in order to create a space of identity, a sense of belonging and community in MacArthur Park (Main &amp; Sandoval, 2015).

<p><strong>Cultivating Belonging: Refugees, Urban Gardens and Placemaking</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>According to Saldivar-Tanaka &amp; Krasny (2004), community gardens can promote stronger neighborhoods and civic engagement by providing spaces for agriculture and social interaction (cited in Strunk &amp; Richardson, 2019). In their study Strunk &amp; Richardson (2019) look at planning, and placemaking in Rock Island, Illinois through an ethnography of community gardens tended primarily by recent refugees. While city officials see urban gardens as temporary, well-maintained spaces devoted to food production, for the refugee gardeners, the garden transcends this narrow view as being a space of temporary land use (Strunk &amp; Richardson, 2019). Suffice it to say, the garden represents an inclusive space where city residents can share land, food, and cultural practices (Strunk &amp; Richardson, 2019). From the study Strunk &amp; Richardson (2019) argue that the gardeners (a mixture of refugees from East and West Africa, South and South-East Asia; Mexican immigrants; along with long-term African American and Anglo gardeners) “construct identities and belonging rooted in gardens through the transfer of agricultural knowledge and produce to friends, family, and other community members” (p. 5). They further suggest that the agricultural knowledge that is transferred across ethnicities and generations serves as a means of challenging “traditional understandings of agriculture, nature, and urban planning, which dictate how people see green spaces and gardens in the city, by promoting alternative ways of using and creating places in the city, embodied in the ideal of the community’s garden” (Strunk &amp; Richardson, 2019, p. 5). Ultimately, the community gardens promote and represent an inclusive space that allows for a diverse set of refugees and long-term residents to come together and develop new social relationships.</p>
<p>While the study does uncover that the refugee’s agricultural practices can occasionally result in tense encounters, especially with long-term community members, their presence in the city has forced residents and local officials to confront differences and misunderstandings in the garden (Strunk &amp; Richardson, 2019). Strunk &amp; Richardson (2019) conclude that some issues remain unresolved; however, the community gardens have been a crucial element in ongoing discussions about community development, migrant incorporation, and sustainability in Rock Island.

<p><strong>Creating a Sense of Place: The Vietnamese Americans and Little Saigon</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The study establishes the importance of ethnic enclaves in creating a sense of space for resettlers. Unlike other immigrants resettling in the US, the federal government was actively involved in dispersing Vietnamese refugees across the country (Henslin, 1996 cited in Mazumdar, Mazumdar, Docuyanan &amp; Mclaughlin, 2000). This act of dispersion Henslin (1996) argues, initially robbed this immigrant group of the opportunity to establish their ethnic communities like their European counterparts. However, the effect of the US federal government’s actions was not lasting, as over time the Vietnamese started regrouping with family and friends, forged social networks, appropriated new places and built a sense of community in their reclaimed spaces (Mazumdar, et al., 2000). Little Saigon in Westminster and Garden Grove, California, became one such reclaimed place, representing memory, hope and a symbol of their lost capital and homeland. This sense of belonging was solidified when the then Governor visited Westminster and officially dedicated the name Little Saigon to the area (Mazumdar, et al., 2000).</p>
<p>The story of the Vietnamese experience is one of pain and loss – loss of nation, home, family, culture and identity (Mazumdar, et al., 2000). They were ravaged by war, violently pushed out their home country, separated from family members and struggled as they sought to reestablish their roots in the US. What began in the 1970s with a few shops has grown today to include over 2000 businesses including major shopping centers, mini malls, supermarkets, restaurants, professional offices, nail salons, flower shops, bakeries and other services. From the signs on shops and businesses in both Vietnamese and English, to the sound of the Vietnamese language and the aroma of the Vietnamese cuisine, Little Saigon has become not only the commercial hub but the emotional focal point of the Vietnamese community in America. How did this community become the force it is today? Mazumdar, et al. (2000) highlight three key components that facilitated the process of Little Saigon becoming the center of the Vietnamese identity and attachment, thus creating a sense of place:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Architecture – In order to sustain the ethnic character of Little Saigon, the use of some architectural features and symbols have been formalized through the creation of a Design Standards Manual by the City of Westminster.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Social life – This element builds upon the architectural component. The place feels like home because of how the space is utilized, the character and lifestyle of the place, and simply just the presence of Vietnamese people. Mazumdar, et al. (2000) posit that for the newly arrived Vietnamese, “the enclave provides a cultural buffer zone, a cultural bridge, helping to minimize the stress of transition and culture shock” (p. 324). The enclave provides other cultural services as well, as non-profit organizations help with initial adjustment. For a non-English speaker, language can be an isolating experience when settling in the US. In Little Saigon, English classes are offered through non-profit organizations, if a newcomer is so inclined. In addition, employment within the enclave is not an issue as the primary means of communication is Vietnamese (Mazumdar, et al., 2000).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Religion and ceremonial events – In addition to being a commercial space with an active social life, Little Saigon is a center of religious life as well, serving as a place for individual and collective ritual events. Mazumdar, et al., 2000 notes that Vietnamese stores, businesses and restaurants have altars dedicated to Buddha, ancestors and other religious icons, and individual shop owners often offer prayers at specific times of the day. On special days, additional ceremonies and rituals are conducted collectively. One event of particular significance to the Vietnamese is the Tet festival. It involves several family-centered ceremonies and rituals that occur within the home; however, preparation for Tet and its celebration is not confined to homes but spills over to businesses and shops (Mazumdar, et al., 2000).
Mazumdar, et al. (2000) conclude that the built architectural environment and the immigrants' “social, commercial, and ritual activities interact to create and sustain a sense of place, foster community identity, and structure social relations” (p. 319). Immigrant groups seek to create their own communities where their cultural identity can be preserved and interaction with the new society mediated.

<p><strong>Placemaking in Rural USA</strong></p>
<p>The case study focuses on Latino/a rural placemaking practices in Perry, Iowa. While it is that the main goal of Sandoval &amp; Maldonado (2012) study is to document placemaking practices in small towns for planning and development purposes, the aim here is to highlight the successes the Latino/a community has had in creating a sense of place in a US rural setting.</p>
<p>Sandoval &amp; Maldonado (2012) note that there have been a range of challenges experienced by Latino/a community in reclaiming the space; however, they have been successful in building some connections. One key area is related to the emergence of Latino/a entrepreneurs, who have been key in revitalizing Perry’s downtown area by providing goods and services to both Latino/a and non-Latino/a customers. These Latino/a businesses have provided a local alternative to large chains located in adjacent urban areas. Studies on Latino/a small businesses suggest that these establishments serve to anchor a larger Latino/a population within communities (Chaganti &amp; Greene, 2002; O’Brien, 2008 cited in Sandoval &amp; Maldonado, 2012). In the town of Perry, the foregoing is done by Latino/a small businesses contributing to local economies through job creation, decreasing the amount of commercial vacancy rates in small towns, which ultimately serves as “important spatial, cultural and economic anchors for the emerging Latino/a community” (Sandoval, 2010 cited in andoval &amp; Maldonado, 2012Sandoval &amp; Maldonado, 2012, p. 209). Another key point of success in this area is that Latino/a small businesses in Perry further contribute to creating a sense of place by sponsoring local cultural celebrations, sporting events (such as soccer leagues), religious festivities and other community events (Sandoval &amp; Maldonado, 2012).</p>
<p>Rituals associated with traditional and religious festivities have also been an important placemaking venue for Latino/as in Perry. Sandoval &amp; Maldonado (2012) suggest “that providing safe spaces for cultural expression and appreciation is critical for enabling Latino/a placemaking efforts in small rural towns” (p. 209). Las Posadas, a Catholic religious festival that occurs yearly in December, appears to constitute such a safe cultural space. The Perry Latino/a festival is another cultural venue that attracts the participation of both Latino/a and non-Latino/a residents in a positive celebration of music, food and regional/national Latino/a heritages.</p>
<p>Although it can be argued that the cultural events “tether on ‘exoticizing’ Latino/a cultures, they also serve to give Latino/as a positive type of visibility in the town” (Sandoval &amp; Maldonado, 2012, p. 209). The Latino cultural festival now takes place in the historic town center; it used to be held in the outskirts of town but was later moved to the town’s centre following recommendations from the Iowa State University Latino Urbanism studio (Sandoval &amp; Maldonado, 2012). The move of the festival to the town’s center is significant because, symbolically, it recognizes Latino/as and Latino/a cultures as central and integral to the Perry community. Despite the challenges, the Latino/a presence is changing urban, suburban and rural landscapes throughout the US, as Latino/as continue to reshape the physical landscapes of the communities in which they live and labour.

<p><strong>Ethnic Entrepreneurship and Placemaking in Suburban Toronto</strong></p>
<p>In her study, Zhuang (2019) establishes placemaking as a “process of enhancing the environment to meet the needs of the community as defined by its citizens” (p. 522). Adhya (2012) contends that “effective placemaking results in people-centered spaces, and allows people and the community to ‘define, construct and control the quality of their own environments’” (quoted in Zhuang, 2019, p. 522). Ergo, community engagement, participation, and empowerment are of paramount importance in placemaking, which all serve to establish a connection between people and the places in which they live (Galanakis, 2013 &amp; Karacor, 2014 cited in Zhuang, 2019).</p>
<p>According to Zhuang (2019), empirical and theoretical focus on urban settings in the study of placemaking has left significant gaps in our understanding of how placemaking is affected by context, specifically in suburban areas. Arguably, the success of an ethnic community rests on its proximity to the city core, accessible transit, and interactions with various urban crowds. In contrast, suburban ethnic entrepreneurs face geographic isolation from the urban core, car-dependency, restrictive zoning, and a disconnect with the wider community (Zhuang, 2019).</p>
<p>Immigrants negotiate their belonging by engaging in creating places (Ehrkamp, 2005 cited in Zhuang, 2019). Few studies of migration have explored the multi-faceted, complex nature of everyday ethnic placemaking experiences and associations, especially in the suburbs (Phillips &amp; Robinson, 2015 cited in Zhuang, 2019). The spatial and physical outcomes of ethnic entrepreneurship are clearly different in urban versus suburban settings, so the ways ethnic entrepreneurs interact in public matters may not be applicable in a suburban context. Suburban ethnic business concentrations are typically driven by the social, cultural, economic, and political needs of the ethnic community, so it is important to clarify the roles of ethnic entrepreneurs in suburban placemaking. That said, Zhuang, 2019 explores the complex processes involved in suburban placemaking among Chinese &amp; South Asian retailers and how they use their spaces within a wider political-institutional context.</p>
<p>Like Fong et al. (2007) who compared suburban and urban Chinese businesses, Zhuang (2019) also found that suburban retailers were more limited in their choice of location, as they tend to cluster along arterial roads around major transit stops or around existing shopping malls to maximize customer flow. She also found, however, that even though there may be challenges with customer traffic on account of the distances from the city center, the placemaking practices employed by the retailers within these suburban business areas “are not just for retail but serve as major community hubs by providing important community facilities, functions, and services” (Zhuang, 2019, p. 532). For example, for South Asian religious spaces are important. As such, one entrepreneur noted that he built a temple within a suburban retail plaza to benefit local residents and businesses. This he added aided in the success of the plaza (Zhuang, 2019). Chinese indoor shopping malls, on the other hand, played an important role in community life by offering year-round indoor spaces for community activities and functions, such as organized group exercises among seniors or community/business group events or promotions (Zhuang, 2019). The foregoing examples demonstrate how ethnic entrepreneurs can make their voice heard and how diverse community needs can be negotiated through partnerships. Overall, the ongoing stereotype that suburbs are “placeless” and are merely dotted by “big box” stores does not take into consideration the efforts of ethnic communities (Zhuang &amp; Chen, 2017 cited in Zhuang, 2019).

<p><strong>The Case of Bangladeshi Fish Stores on Devon Avenue, Chicago</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>For this case study, Sen (2016) looks at the complex connection between food, place, and memory. He argues that food remains a central artifact in ethnic cultural practices, as it often serves as a means of creating a sense of place for immigrant populations (Sen, 2016). This study looks at Devon Avenue, a South Asian retail street in the city of Chicago, to examine a complex “sense of place,” sustained by this thoroughfare. Even though on first sight the street may seem to be a generic ethnic enclave, closer scrutiny may reveal a nuanced spatiality of its subcultures. The focus is on a small subgroup of Bangladeshi-owned grocery stores (within a larger South Asian immigrant marketplace) that sell imported riverine fish. This commodity is unique to the Ganges delta along the Bay of Bengal. The frozen fish packages available in these stores are predominantly exported from Bangladesh. Sen (2016) notes that the goal of this narrow scope of the study is to focus on how “the spatiality of comestibles opens up the complexity surrounding ethnic foodscapes and the relationships between food, memory, and place” (p. 68).</p>
<p>Since the early 1990s, a wave of immigration from Bangladesh has brought entrepreneurs to Chicago who set up grocery stores to cater to a burgeoning Bengali population. Even though their numbers are small compared to Indians and Pakistanis, there has been a 153% increase in the number of Bangladeshis in Illinois between the 2000 and 2010 census figures. Despite these growing numbers, there is a dearth of knowledge about Bangladeshis and their cultural impact on this neighborhood (Sen, 2016).</p>
<p>Coakley (2010) argues that food tends to generate “‘a sense of home as a distant absent becomes present bringing ‘the there here [and] the then now”’ (quoted in Sen, 2016, p. 72). She further argues that the very sight or taste of ethnic food may remind immigrants of a place, time, and geography that they have left behind (cited in Sen, 2016). This feeling of the “then” being in the “present” “is embodied and experiential in nature and it requires a creative remaking of place (Sen, 2016, p. 72). Sen (2016) notes that ethnic food, such as fish, serves as a boundary object because of its ability to mediate across geographies, environments, culinary traditions, and histories – boundary objects or practices are mobile and shared across social, linguistic, and environmental domains. As a boundary object, references to fish at a more general cultural level may not mean much; however, at an individual level it may take on a different meaning (Sen, 2016). For example, Sen (2016) highlights that “Bengalis love fish,” which in and of itself may imply the Bengalis are pescatarian. However, on an individual level, this “’love for fish’ could take the form of memories of personal and family dinners, taste memories from childhood, or home recipes and cooking practices or be a way to retain their heritage and traditions that they fear they would lose as a result of immigration” (Sen, 2016, p. 71).</p>
<p>Participants from the study note that going to Devon Avenue is important because it produces a connection with their home place. The food that is sold is what they are used to from their home country, so when they buy Bengali fish it really brings back memory (Sen, 2016). Some participants note that visiting Devon Avenue is a part of their weekly routine. Fish stores on Devon Avenue reproduce a unique sense of place for Bengali immigrants by becoming part of their everyday cultural landscape (Sen, 2016). Sens (2016) asserts that “repeated visits have produced unique bodily memories of fish shopping for customers, so that these stores enter their lexicon as ‘Bengali places’” (p. 75). Just by the very act of shopping in Bengali fish stores on Devon Avenue, local Bengalis have reimagined the landscape of Devon as part of their cultural landscape.

<p><strong>INCREMENTAL HOUSING: THE CHILEAN EXPERIENCE Chile, South America COMMUNITY LED HOUSING DESIGN</strong></p>
<p>The dynamic concept of incremental housing is being used in Chile’s informal sectors in order to improve and revitalize residential areas, as well as reconfigure the housing design to allow for a higher density on owned plots of land in order to provide more living space for allegados (extended family and relatives). A notable feature of this initiative is the collaborative efforts that have been taken to ensure community members are included in the housing design process throughout the project.
Partnership of prominent architect Alejandro Aravena has led the design process and has helped to empower the community members by giving them the opportunity to design their own homes. This allows for flexibility as it provides families the option to expand naturally as needed with the modular design.
The Marshallese Community could benefit from this design model that develops housing and community facilities that compliment the various phases of their lives and reflect core values and aspirations for the future.
